[![youtube video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ImVK5cGVrpQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImVK5cGVrpQ)

This is some code for a WiFi-Button project using Mongoose OS
After flashing Mongoose on your microcontroller simply
replace the contents of the init.js with the corresponding file.
The button uses a direct link or mqtt.
The Actuator simply moves a servo connected to D1(aon WemMos MCU)
